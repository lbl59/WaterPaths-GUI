# WaterPaths
A utility planning and management tool based off the NC Triangle model.

## What is included in this repository
- Source code (`/src`).
- NC Triangle water planning and management problem (`src/Problem/PaperTestProblem.cpp`).
- NC Triangle data (`/TestFiles`).
- Sample input time series (`/TestFiles/inflows`, `evaporation`, `demand`) with 64 realizations each.

## Compiling WaterPaths
Use Makefile provided in source directory. E.g., if using GCC run 
```
make gcc
```

## Running WaterPaths
To print a list of flags to for running WaterPaths, use 
```
./waterpaths -?
```

### Running WaterPaths in simulation mode
For running a reduced version of the NC Triangle model in full simulation mode, run:
``` 
./waterpaths -T 4 -t 2344 -r 64 -d /your/current/path/ -s sample_solutions.csv -m 0 
```
The argument of flag -T is the number of threads to be created using OpenMP. If -T flag is not used, the 64 realizations will be distributed across all physical and virtual cores.

There are three options for decreasing runtime for testing purposes that can be used individually or together:
- Decreasing the number of realizations (-r flag)
- Decreasing the simulation time (-t flag) to no less than 53 (weeks)
- Generating pre-computed risk-of-failure (ROF) tables to be used during runs. Keep in mind that if using a different set of inflow, evaporation, of RDM files will warrant new tables. To generate tables, run 
```
./triangleSimulation -T 4 -t 2344 -r 64 -d /your/current/path/ -s sample_solutions.csv -m 0 -C 1
```
 To run a function evaluation using the tables, set value of -C flag to -1.

### Runnning WaterPaths with Borg MS in optimization mode
To get a copy of Borg, go to Borg's [official website](http://borgmoea.org/) and request access to the source  code (free for non-commercial use). You should soon after get an e-mail with a link to its repository, where you can download the source code from.

To run WaterPaths in optimization mode, WaterPaths needs to be re-compiled with Borg and the appropriate flags must be passed when calling it from the command line with a program like mpirun. To do so, follow the following steps:
1. In order to run WaterPaths with Borg, the library libborgms.a must be provided in the /lib folder. To do so, borgmoea.org/ and request a licence, move Borg files to the folder /borg, compile borg by running `make mpi` in /borg, and finally move the file libborgms.a to the /lib folder.
2. After libborgms.a is compiled and place in /lib, compile WaterPaths with `make borg`.
3. Copy directories cube:/scratch/bct52/TestFiles and cube:/scratch/bct52/rof_tables_cac/ to your directory of preference, or 
Define a `${DATA_DIR}` that includes a `rof_tables_cac/` directory and the `TestFiles/` directory. 
4. Run WaterPaths with 
```
mpiexec --hostfile nodefile -np 3 -x OMP_NUM_THREADS ./waterpaths -T 5 -t 2344 -r ${N_REALIZATIONS} -d ${DATA_DIR} -C -1 -O ${DATA_DIR}rof_tables_cac/ -U TestFiles/rdm_utilities_reeval.csv -P TestFiles/rdm_dmp_reeval.csv -W TestFiles/rdm_water_sources_reeval.csv -b true -n 202 -o 100 -e 1
```
 The WaterPaths call above is optimized for a node with 16 cores and will spawn 3 MPI processes running on 5 threats each. Be sure to change the nodefile (see single_run_borgms.sh) and the value of the -T flag for nodes with different number of cores. 
5. The run should take less than 10 minutes if 16 or more cores are being used. The two output files of this run should now be in `${DATA_DIR}/output/`. The NC_output_MM_S1_N202.set file should consist on a space-separated matrix with 20-80 rows by 63 columns. The /scratch/bct52/output/NC_runtime_MM_S1_N202.runtime file should have between 90 and 200 lines.

# Using the InputFileParser
To simulate and optimize a custom water resource system, the InputFileParser provides front-end support.

## Structure
To create your own model in WaterPaths, generate a plain-text file (.wp extension), following the format of the files in the `Tests` directory and described in detail below.

### Blocks
WaterPaths looks for ***blocks*** of information, which are delimited by *tags* and describe information on *parameters*.
A ***block*** follows the following form:

```
[TAG]
parameter value
parameter value
...
```

where a [TAG] is an upper-case keyword (defined below) enclosed in brackets and each *parameter* with a corresponding *value*.

### Values
The rest of this documentation will refer to value types as follows:

| Value Type    | Description                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| int           | Standard integer (e.g. 1)                                               |
| double        | Standard double-precision value (e.g. 1.05)                             |
| string        | Standard string                                                         |

| dir           | Path to a directory                                                     |
| Utility       | Name of a declared utility.                                             |
| Source        | Name of a declared water source (reservoir, allocated reservoir, reuse) |
| type,type     | Two values of type separated by commas                                  |
| type,type,... | One or more values of type separated by commas                          |
| type type     | Two values of type separated by spaces                                  |
| type type ... | One or more values of type separated by spaces                          |

Additionally, the type `bond info` can be represented as 
```
level int int int int deferred
```
which corresponds to 
```
type cost_of_capital n_payments coupon_rate pay_on_weeks begin_repayment_at_issuance
```
Currently, `level` is the only bond type available and `deferred` is the only repayment setting.

### [DATA TO LOAD]
To load *csv* data needed for a WaterPaths simulation, use
```
filename csv
```
where `filename` is a unique name used to reference the csv file at `csv` in the remainder of the input file. <br/>
To load only the first `n_realizations` lines of the file, use `*` before the filename:
```
*filename csv
```
Without `*`, the entire file will be loaded.

### [WATER SOURCES GRAPH]
This tag creates the network of a water resources system as a graph, with edges corresponding to connections between reservoirs, allocated reservoirs, and water reuses. <br/> 
There are no parameters in this block; instead, each line represents a directed *edge* in the water source graph. Each entry must be the `name` of a declared water source.<br/> 
If a connection exists between `source1` and `source2`, include a line in this block as such:
```
source1,source2
```
For example, this InputFileParser graph and its visual map are shown.
```
source1,source2
source2,source3
source4,source5
source5,source3
```

### [UTILITIES GRAPH]
This tag is similar to [WATER SOURCES GRAPH], except for utilites. An *edge* between water sources represents a potential water exchange between two utilites. The same format as [WATER SOURCES GRAPH] is followed.

### [WS TO UTILITY MATRIX]
WaterPaths represents the connections between utilities and water sources as
```
utility source1,source2,...
```
where `utility` is a utillity name and the subsequent `sources` are water source names. Here, `utility` uses `source1`, `source2`, and all following sources to reach its demand. Each declared utility must have its own line in this block.

### [TABLE STORAGE SHIFT]

Here, we define a matrix for respective table shortage shifts for potential reservoir expansions.<br/>
Entries should be in the following form:
```
Utility Reservoir shift
```
where `shift` is the integer representing associated reservoir table shift.

### [DECISON VARIABLE BOUNDS]
If this WaterPaths simulation is an optimization, this block tells the BorgMOEA which variables to optimize within the WaterPaths framework. Each line should follow this format:
```
index lowerbound,upperbound
```
The `lowerbound` and `upperbound` numeric values indicate the lowest and highest values this decision variable can take. <br/>
The `index` value is an integer, and each value in *0..n-1*, where *n* is the number of decision varaibles, must be taken. <br/>

A decision variable's `index` describes its relative ordered position within the *.wp* file. To declare a specific decision variable instance in another block, use `%%%` for optimized *values* and `@` preceding an alias for optimized orderings. <br/>

For example, consider a simple optimization case with 4 decision variables.<br/>

1. Declare the decision varibles in a [DECISION VARIABLE BOUNDS] block.
```
[DECISION VARIABLE BOUNDS]
0 0.001,0.75    # utility1 transfer ROF trigger
1 0.0,1,0       # source1 construction rank
2 0.0,1.0       # source2 construction rank
3 0.0,1.0       # source3 construction rank
```

2. Declare decision variable `0` (utility1 transfer ROF trigger) within a [TRANSFERS POLICY] block with a `%%%`
```
[TRANSFERS POLICY]
apply_to_utilities utility1
source_utility_id RandomUtility
...
buyers_transfer_triggers %%%
```

3. Declare decison variables `1` `2` and `3` (construction ranks) within a [UTILITY] block with a series of `@`
```
[UTILITY]
name RandomUtlity
...
rof_infra_construction_order @source1,@source2,@source3
...
```

This input file configuration will optimize a short-term transfer ROF for `utility1` and a long-term infrastructure expansion ordering for each `source`. Ensure that the intended ordering of decision varaibles (as declared within the [DECISION VARIABLES BOUNDS] block) corresponds to the order of appearence in the remainder of the input file. <br/>

For a more advanced optimization problem formulation, refer to `Tests/test_input_file_borg.wp`. 

### [OBJECTIVES EPSILONS]
This tag declares the epsilon values for the five objectives:
1. Reliability
2. Restriction Frequency
3. Infrastructure NPV
4. Financial Cost
5. Worse First Percentile Cost

This block has one line, in the form:
```
ep1,ep2,ep3,ep4,ep5
```
where each epsilon corresponds to the respective numbered objective.<br/>

To use the recommended epsilon values, include this block:
```
[OBJECTIVES EPSILONS]
0.001,0.02,10.0,0.025,0.01
```
